There is a bug in Javadoc: it sometimes does not visit all private nested classes.
Using JDK 8, it did not visit BaseTypeChecker.CheckerMessageComparator in the Checker Framework.


Diffing:

Build diffing into RequireJavadoc

Add command-line argument
--diff-file FILENAME

Benefits:  This saves 3 lines at https://github.com/plume-lib/require-javadoc#incremental-use
This also makes it easier for users to run RequireJavadoc locally before pushing to Travis (as opposed to the user writing it all in a git commit hook).

Implementation:
This will operate by:
 * read in --diff-file and construct the same data structure that
 https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plume-lib/plume-scripts/master/lint-diff.py
 currently does
 * Check the data structure before outputting a warning.

Further possible feature:
We could save one more line (plus a rm command for the diff file, I guess) by also supporting, for convenience:
  --git-diff BRANCHNAME
eg
  --git-diff master
This requires integrating git support into require-javadoc
